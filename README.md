# FoundryVTT Loot Generator

This is a work in progress, but right now it can quickly roll treasure items (including updating their values correctly), roll consumables, and roll magic items. Works with the quick mystification feature if you want the items to need appraisal (hold alt as usual). It's a separate loot sheet, as noted in the preview image (click on Settings in the header and use the `pf2e-toolbox.LootApp` sheet).
